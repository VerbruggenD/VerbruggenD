# Hi, I'm Dieter

- I'm a Master's student in electronics & ICT engineering technology at University Hasselt and KU Leuven.
- I have a bachelors degree in electronics.
- I am really interested in physics, nanotechnology and robotics.
- I code for personal and educational purposes.
- Mainly in Python and raw C, but also some C++, C# and java.
- Iâ€™m currently working on a Machine Learning project for stroke predictions.
- Also, I am working on my master's thesis: An rowing stroke analyzer and automated feedback.
